Yes, it's entirely possible to create user sessions without the users ever creating a password by using a one-time password (OTP) sent to their email. This concept is often referred to as "passwordless" authentication.

Here's a rough overview of the process:

    User Registration/Log-in Request: The user enters their email address.

    Email Verification: The server sends a unique OTP to the user's email.

    User Verification: The user enters the OTP they received in their email.

    Token Generation: Upon successful verification, the server creates a JSON Web Token (JWT) for the user.

    User Authentication: This token is then used to authenticate the user for their session.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the process:

    User Registration/Log-in Request: The user provides their email address via the UI. The client sends this email address to the server.

    Email Verification (OTP Generation and Sending): The server generates an OTP and stores it in the database with a relation to the email and a short expiration time. The OTP is then sent to the user's email address.

    User Verification (OTP Verification): The user retrieves the OTP from their email and enters it in the UI. This OTP is sent to the server for verification. If the OTP matches what's stored in the database (and it hasn't expired), the server considers the user as verified.

    Token Generation (JWT Creation): The server generates a JWT that contains user-specific data (like user ID) and signs it with a secret key. This token will have its own expiration time.

    User Authentication: The server sends this JWT back to the client. The client stores this JWT (usually in local storage, cookies, or memory) and includes it in the Authorization header for all subsequent requests. The server checks the token for each request to ensure it's valid and not expired.

In terms of the data stored in the database, you would need to store:

    User's email address
    OTP related to the user's email
    Expiration time of the OTP

The advantage of this approach is that you don't need to store any password information, reducing security risks associated with password storage. The OTP expires after one use or after a certain time limit, enhancing security.

The JWT, which is stored on the client side, typically includes a payload with user data, which is Base64Url encoded. This data can be decoded to extract the user data, but without the secret key, it cannot be tampered with or re-encoded. The server can verify whether the token was tampered with by checking its signature.

Remember to securely handle JWTs to prevent exposure. If an attacker gets hold of a JWT, they can impersonate a user. So, you should always use HTTPS, consider using HttpOnly cookies for storing JWTs, and implement adequate session timeout.

This approach doesn't mean the system will be completely secure. You should still consider other security aspects, like rate limiting OTP requests, securing your JWT secret key, providing an option for users to log out (invalidate JWT), among others.
